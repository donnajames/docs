title: Multi-Agents Chatbot
---

GPT-trainer is the first and most powerful LLM-native conversational AI platform that
implements a multi-agent architecture. Multiple AI Agents work together in a coordinated orchestration
to enable you to create solutions with unprecedented versatility, speed, and automation.

We present this guide to help you understand how our Agents work together, as well as share
with you some best practices surrounding multi-agent chatbot design.

GPT-trainer has 2 types of Agents:

    - **User-facing:** Agent directly interacts with users conversationally in a Q&A fashion.
    Only a single user-facing Agent engages with the user when a new query is input into the chatbot.

    - **Background:** Agent never interacts with users directly and instead monitors the conversation
    in an ongoing fashion. All background Agents are run whenever the user submits a new query to the chatbot.

</Frame>

All Agents have two states:

    - **Active:** Agent is “Connected”. It is live and running.
    - **Inactive:** Agent is “Disabled”. It does not do anything.

Since only a single user-facing Agent engages with the user at any given time, our system
must choose the best user-facing Agent based on their respective specializations. To do this,
we have our own AI Supervisor working in the background to conduct **intent classification**.

<Note>
  Agents are completely isolated from one another. This means that you cannot
  direct the behavior, bias, or selection priority of one Agent from inside
  another Agent.
</Note>

Since the only reliable source of information our AI Supervisor has when determining which Agent
is best suited to perform which tasks is the “Agent Description”, it is **absolutely crucial** that you provide
an explicit and clear description for **every User Facing Agent**.

Good Agent descriptions should answer the question **“What type of queries should the Agent handle?”**
More specifically, Agent descriptions should encompass all relevant “user intents” that it is supposed to handle.
Here are some examples of good Agent descriptions:

    Embody the role of "GPT-trainer Expert," a specialized guide for GPT-trainer. Your main objective is to assist users with answering GPT-trainer-related questions related to:
    - Use cases
    - Features and capabilities
    - Data security
    - Pricing
    - AI Agents and multi-Agent architecture
    - User identity verification
    - Chunk curation
    - Function calling
    - Partnership program
    - Custom domains
    - Tokens

    All intents handled by this Agent should be related to GPT-trainer.

  <Accordion title="Unrelated Query Defender">
    The Unrelated Query Defender Agent handles any user queries not related to GPT-trainer. This includes requests for:
    - writing assistance
    - artistic expressions
    - homework help
    - professional advice
    - making selections

  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

Agent descriptions **should not** include details about “how the Agent performs its job”.
That part should be reserved for the Agent’s base prompt. Text such as “Agent provides informed
answers based on knowledge from the source library.” is not needed and can be distracting to the AI Supervisor.

So what makes for a good multi-agent chatbot design? How can I ensure that all my intended user intents are handled by the appropriate Agent?

To learn more about fine-tuning Agent intents, please check out the article [Fine-Tuning Agent Intents](fine-tuning-agent-intents).

In our AI Supervisor routing design, we use an algorithm that balances latency, consistency,
and comprehensiveness. It will not always give you 100% accuracy,
but you can get pretty close if you design your chatbots effectively.

## Debugging the chatbot

If you notice that the chatbot is not responding to your expectations, then there may be two causes.

1. The wrong Agent may have been assigned to handle the incoming user query.
2. The Agent itself may not be optimally configured.

To find out whether your intended Agent has been selected to handle the user’s query, go to “Inbox” and turn on debug mode.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Under “Active Agent”, you will see the Agent that generated the response. Please note that you will only see “Active Agent” metadata
if you have more than one active user-facing Agents.

If the Agent that handled the user query was not the correct one, you can return to Agent configuration and update its name, description,
or prompt.

If the correct Agent handled the user query but the response was not what you expected, then the issue resides within the Agent itself.
You will then need to update the Agent configuration. The most straightforward way to fix a response is by revising the AI’s answer directly:

This ensures that the chatbot will generate an answer based on what you revised every time it encounters the question in the future, assuming
the same Agent was chosen to respond to the query.

If you’d like to make the Agent more robust and consistent in general, you can curate the training data, choose a more powerful LLM, or be more
explicit in your base prompt. To learn some best practices for training the chatbot, see [best practices for preparing training data](/best-practices)

**Happy building!**
