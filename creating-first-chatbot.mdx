title: Create Your First Chatbot
---

To get started, first log in to your account. If this is your first time using GPT-trainer, you will be asked to complete some 
initial onboarding steps, including a brief survey. Afterwards, you will be presented with this screen:

Click on **Create from Template**.

The **Chatbot Name** is for your reference within your account, helping you identify which chatbot you're working with.
The **Display Name**, visible in the chatbot interface, can be set now or added later.

After you are finished, click "Continue". For your first chatbot, let's pick the template "Q&A with Anti-Spam Defense". 
This chatbot will have 2 AI Agents built-in: one for general Q&A, one for handling spam and malicious input.

Next, add your company or product name, followed by an alternative way for your users to contact your support team. 
The chatbot will take on the persona of an AI representative within your organization and redirect any user query it cannot 
handle to the support channel you indicate here.

Afterwards, you can customize the basic appearance of your chatbot widget. You can review how things look in the preview on 
the right.

Please note that this is a simplified subset of options. You can customize a lot more elements later in the "Settings / Appearance" 
tab after your chatbot has been successfully created.

Finally, the chatbot is ready for training. You can start by pasting your website's URL into the "Add Website URL(s)" text box. 
Our scraper will attempt to identify and capture all the subdirectories associated with your provided link as well. 

Alternatively, you can provide the sitemap of your website for a more comprehensive capture.

You can also upload unstructured text training data in the form of PDFs, Word, or TXT. 

Additional training data types like 
tables, CSV, Excel, etc. can be uploaded afterwards in the "Sources" tab.

Once you designated your desired training data, head on to the next step. Don't worry if you missed some, because you can always 
review and update your training data later.

Wait for the training to complete. Then, click "Try it out". GPT-trainer will open a new tab where you can start testing the 
preliminary chatbot.

In general, the chatbot should be well-configured enough as-is for most common use cases. However, if you would like to fine tune 
the chatbot behavior further, update the training data or appearance, or even add additional AI Agents to expand the chatbot's 
capabilities, you can do it in GPT-trainer.

Close the chatbot testing tab. You will return to GPT-trainer's main interface. Go through the onboarding guide to learn more 
about your options.

When you are ready to deploy your chatbot, head to the **Deploy / Integrations** tab.

If you want to share the chatbot as a standalone page, simply click **Link**. You should see a share link automatically generated for you.

If you want to embed the chatbot onto a web page, click **Website**. Detailed instructions will be displayed on the new right sidebar.

To add more chatbots, simply go to the left sidebar and click the dropdown menu. You will be taken to a dedicated page to manage all of your 
chatbots.

<Note>
  Please note that depending on your current subscription plan, there is a limit
  to the number of chatbots you can create.
